## Project Description

Galvanize Dungeon Crawler (working title) is a browser game made in GameMaker Studio 2. It is a top-down action-adventure in the vein of The Legend of Zelda.

## What problem does your project solve?

The browser space has a lack of polished games in this style that are fun to play, have nice looking graphics, and will save the player's progress for multiple play sessions.

## Who has this problem?

Gamers bored at work, of course!

## How will your project solve this problem?

It will deliver a game that is challenging, fast-paced, highly polished and free of the "jank" that plagues many browser games.

## What inputs does it need?

A player name to start the session, and then the player's input which would be up, down, left, right, pause, and three action buttons which are mapped to equippable items in the pause menu.

## What outputs does it produce?

The graphics and sound that the player sees.

## What technologies do you plan to use?

GameMaker Studio 2 with HTML5 module, GameMaker WebAPI, Firebase, Heroku
